# Disciples 3 speed patch, by Daniel Heath

## What does it do?
Disciples 3 is a very, very slow game. So slow I couldn't enjoy it.
Fortunately, this is fixable; the game speed is stored in a configuration file and it's easy to change.

## Use it
Download d3patcher.exe and run it.
If you have any trouble, hit me up (@danielrheath on twitter) - I am happy to help.

It needs to know where to find your disciples 3 folder.
If you installed disciples 3 from steam, the patcher should autodetect the location and apply the patch automatically.
Otherwise you will need to type out the path to your install.

## Implementation

I've compiled the ruby script using 'ocra', which was really simple to use.
